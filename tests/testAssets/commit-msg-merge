Merge Damage report! The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once.

I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. This should be interesting. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere!
